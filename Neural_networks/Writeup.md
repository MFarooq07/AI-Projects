# Backpropagation Learning System

The provided code implements a backpropagation learning system for feedforward neural networks. This system is designed to train neural networks for various tasks, including XOR function approximation and auto-association.

## XOR Function Approximation

The first part of the code trains a neural network to approximate the XOR function. XOR is a classic example of a problem that cannot be solved with a single linear model. The backpropagation algorithm allows the neural network to learn the non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. After training, the network is tested on all possible XOR input combinations:

- [0, 0] => [0]
- [0, 1] => [1]
- [1, 0] => [1]
- [1, 1] => [0]

The training process involves forward and backward propagation, with weight adjustments based on prediction errors. The training continues until all patterns are correctly learned or a specified number of training cycles (epochs) is reached.

## Auto-Association

The second part of the code demonstrates auto-association, where the neural network is trained to reproduce its input as the output. In this case, the input and target patterns are identical, allowing the network to learn to recreate the input from its internal representation.

The auto-association network has 8 input units, 3 hidden units, and 8 output units. Each input unit corresponds to a binary feature, and the network learns to replicate the input pattern as the output pattern.

## Results and Analysis

- The code initializes network weights randomly and then trains the network using backpropagation.
- During training, weights are adjusted to minimize the error between the predicted output and the target output.
- The `computeError` method calculates the correctness, total count, score (percentage of correct values), and total sum squared error.

Key Observations:
- The training process may require different numbers of cycles for different tasks and network configurations.
- The choice of learning rate and tolerance can impact the training performance.
- The backpropagation learning system successfully approximates the XOR function and achieves perfect auto-association.

In summary, the backpropagation learning system is capable of training neural networks for various tasks, including those that involve non-linear relationships and pattern replication. It is a fundamental algorithm for supervised learning in neural networks.

For more advanced applications, the system can be extended and adapted to solve a wide range of real-world problems.
