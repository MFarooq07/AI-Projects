# Detailed Feedback

## G.5 writing Markdown

README.md is identical to the original prompt.
Please add a proper writeup to the project using markdown syntax; I would recommend looking at the course repository for a wide range of examples for formatting.


## Python Programming (editing, compiling)

*changePerson* is still included in the program without significant changes and is still used by the program despite specific instructions to fix and/or replace it.

## SS.1A Conversational Agents (Analytical)

Writeup and annotated transcript are missing.
Please add them.
