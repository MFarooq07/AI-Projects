# Project1 Write up 

My chatbot had a couple of conversations with me that were very random.
These conversations did not make sense since the chatbot did not make sense of anything that it was asking me. 
This made the chatbot appear like a person who is not willing to talk at all but something is forcing them to talk
for the sake of showing that they are in a conversation. 
I educated ELIZA to change the pronouns accordingly when replying. ELIZA would use I if I used you in my sentence and 
many more. This made conversations look a bit natural but the questions that were fed into the ELIZA had no condition,
so they came out of no context.


## Some chats with my bot
